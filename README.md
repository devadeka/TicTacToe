# TicTacToe

## Click the following link to play: https://kasiamisirli.github.io/Rick-Tak-Toe/.

Classic TicTacToe game with clean and simple design. Winner of a game is indicated by the flashing icons. If a draw occurs, it is indicated by the board shaking. The bar up top indicates which player's turn it is and how many games each player has won.

### Tools used:
Project uses simple HTML/CSS/JS. Makes use of Google Fonts and Animate.css

### Possible additions:
Functionality additions would be to 
- make the game responsive to landscape view
- retain the number of wins and losses between visits

Code wise, would like to 
- create better data structures for the information.
- remove a few more magic numbers
- create helper functions to toggle different classes.
